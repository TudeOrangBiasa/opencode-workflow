# OpenCode Workflow Kit

> Personal dotfiles + workflow pipeline for OpenCode. Heavy skills (4+ deps, full automation) live in their own repos and integrate via symlinks.

## What this is

This repo is the **personal AI workflow setup**:

- The AI agent's core workflow management skills (write-a-skill, skill-author, dev-workflow, memory-dreaming, etc.)
- Personal setup scripts (install, audit, pre-commit hooks)
- Documentation for project decisions (architecture, extraction criteria, portability rules)
- Symlinks to **external skill packages** that live in their own repos

## Quick start

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone <opencode-workflow-url>

# Install scripts
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Install pre-commit hook (catches hardcoded paths + bad structure)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Set up documents-kit-skills (4 coupled skills for document creation)
./scripts/setup-documents-kit.sh

# Audit any skill
./scripts/audit-skill.sh skills/engineering/skill-author
```

## How to add a new skill

1. Decide: pipeline-level (here) or extractable (own repo)? See [docs/skills/extraction-criteria.md](docs/skills/extraction-criteria.md).
2. Load: **write-a-skill** + **skill-author**
3. Pick the right bucket:
   - `skills/engineering/` — pipeline/daily code-work skills
   - `skills/misc/<domain>/` — specialist skills grouped by domain (`frontend`, `backend`, `languages`, `workflow`, `security`, `ml`, `mobile`, `devops`)
4. Create `skills/<bucket>/skill-name/` with `SKILL.md` (≤100 lines) + optional `REFERENCE.md`
5. Update the bucket `README.md` (and `skills/misc/README.md` for misc sub-domains)
6. Run `./scripts/audit-skill.sh skills/path/to/skill` to verify
7. Pre-commit hook catches hardcoded paths + structural issues

## When to extract a skill

3+ of the 5-point checklist:
- External dependencies > 4
- Needs additional skills to function
- Fully automates a task
- Has multiple patterns/templates
- Independent update cadence

If yes → extract to own repo, integrate via symlink. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the model.

## Anti-hardcoded (portability)

All skills, scripts, and tools must be portable — installable by anyone on any machine. No absolute paths, no OS assumptions, no user-specific defaults.

Rules: [docs/skills/anti-hardcoded-pattern.md](docs/skills/anti-hardcoded-pattern.md)

Enforced by `scripts/check-portable.sh` (pre-commit hook).

## Tools (workflow scripts)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `check-portable.sh` | Scan for hardcoded paths |
| `check-skill-structure.sh` | Verify write-a-skill compliance |
| `audit-skill.sh <path>` | Full single-skill audit |
| `pre-commit.sh` | Run all checks before commit |
| `install-hooks.sh` | Install pre-commit hook |
| `setup-documents-kit.sh` | Create documents-kit symlinks |

## OpenCode Plugins (`.opencode/plugins/`)

Runtime plugins that intercept OpenCode hooks for reliability and personalization:

| Plugin | Tests | Lines | Role |
|--------|-------|-------|------|
| `repair-harness` | 81 | 209 | Intercepts malformed tool args, fixes via 4 deterministic patterns (null drop, JSON parse, markdown strip, array wrap). Auto-disables per-tool when repair rate stabilizes. Kill switch: `REPAIR_HARNESS=off`. |
| `taste` | 34 | 332 | Extracts user preferences from messages (patterns, convention, category) and persists to OpenViking via `ov add-memory`. KL divergence filter for common conventions. |
| `lesson-injector` | 21 | 129 | Fetches past lessons via `ov find` and injects into system prompt. Session cache with 30-min TTL. |
| `ov-helper` | — | 30 | Shared `ovFindJson()` helper — async `Bun.spawn` wrapper for `ov find -o json`. |

All plugins pass **136 tests** (0 fail), **tsc --noEmit clean** (0 errors). Developed via TDD + ponytail across 13 issues (19–31). Per-issue atomic commits.

## License

This is personal dotfiles / workflow setup. Not for public distribution as a whole. Individual skills may be extracted for distribution (see extraction criteria).

## Skill compliance

126/146 skills pass write-a-skill compliance. 20 are in external/personal directories (excluded by design). 0 failed.

Compliance is enforced by:
- `scripts/check-skill-structure.sh` (pre-commit, runs automatically)
- `scripts/audit-skill.sh <skill-path>` (manual single-skill audit)

Last full cleanup: 2026-06-26 — 107 violations (P1 file size + P2 missing trigger) fixed via 3 parallel builder subagents. SKILL.md average went from 377 → 27 lines; 98 new REFERENCE.md created. See [AGENTS.md § Maintenance](AGENTS.md#maintenance) for the pattern.
