# Impeccable — Reference

See [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for routing table, setup, commands, and absolute bans.

## Setup Details

### Context gathering
Two files, case-insensitive:
- **PRODUCT.md**: required. Users, brand, tone, anti-references, strategic principles.
- **DESIGN.md**: optional, strongly recommended. Colors, typography, elevation, components.

Load both: `node {{scripts_path}}/load-context.mjs`

### Register
Every design task is **brand** (marketing, landing, portfolio) or **product** (app UI, dashboard, tool).
Identify before designing. Load matching reference: `reference/brand.md` or `reference/product.md`.

## Shared Design Laws (Detailed)

### Color
- Use OKLCH. Reduce chroma as lightness approaches 0 or 100.
- Never use `#000` or `#fff`. Tint every neutral toward the brand hue.
- Pick a color strategy: **Restrained** (one accent ≤10%), **Committed** (one color 30-60%), **Full palette** (3-4 roles), **Drenched** (surface IS the color).

### Theme
Write one sentence of physical scene before choosing dark/light. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, add detail until it does.

### Typography
- Cap body line length at 65-75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps).

### Layout
- Vary spacing for rhythm. Same padding everywhere is monotony.
- Cards are the lazy answer.
- Don't wrap everything in a container.

### Motion
- Don't animate CSS layout properties.
- Ease out with exponential curves. No bounce, no elastic.

### The AI Slop Test
Two altitudes:
1. **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme+palette from category alone, rework the scene sentence and color strategy.
2. **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references, rework until both answers are not obvious.
