# Architecture

## Role of opencode-workflow

opencode-workflow is the **personal dotfiles + workflow pipeline**. It contains:

- The AI agent's core workflow management skills (grill-with-docs, dev-workflow, memory-dreaming, etc.)
- Personal setup scripts (install, hooks, audit)
- Documentation for project decisions
- Symlinks to heavy skills that live in their own repos

## What lives here vs external

| Lives in opencode-workflow | Lives in external repo | Decision criteria |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Pipeline/agent skills | Anything with 4+ external deps | Heavy = extract |
| Workflow management | Multiple templates/patterns | Multi-purpose = extract |
| Personal dotfiles | Fully automates a task | Automation = extract |
| Meta-skills (skill-author) | Used by others (OSS) | Reusable = extract |
| Documentation | | |

## How integration works

External skill packages integrate via symlinks + MCP registration. All config MUST go through `opencode-workflow` first, never direct to `~/.config/opencode/`.

OpenCode scans 1 level deep per path. `opencode.json` defines multiple leaf paths matching bucket structure (one per sub-bucket with skills). `link-skills.sh` manages this on install/update. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the full policy.

Setup: `scripts/link-skills.sh` creates categorized symlinks in `~/.config/opencode/`.

## When to extract a skill

If a skill:
- Has 4+ external dependencies (MCP, CLI, libs)
- Needs additional skills to function (composition)
- Fully automates a task (not just a helper)
- Has multiple patterns/templates
- Updates frequently independent of the workflow

→ Extract to its own repo, integrate via symlink + setup script.

See [skills/extraction-criteria.md](skills/extraction-criteria.md) for the full checklist.

## How to add a new skill

1. Decide: pipeline-level (here) or extractable (own repo)? See above.
2. If here, pick the right bucket:
   - `engineering/` — pipeline/daily code-work skills (sub-dirs: `planning/`, `design/`, `quality/`, `workflow/`)
   - `productivity/` — non-code workflow tools (documents, research, handoffs, skill authoring)
   - `misc/<domain>/` — specialist skills grouped by domain (`frontend`, `backend`, `languages`, `workflow`, `security`, `ml`, `mobile`, `devops`)
   - `personal/workflow/` or `personal/tools/` — personal workflow or tool skills (not promoted in top-level reference)
3. Create `skills/{bucket}/skill-name/` with `SKILL.md` + optional `REFERENCE.md`
4. If external: create repo with same structure, integrate via symlink
5. Run `./scripts/audit-skill.sh skills/path/to/skill` to verify
6. Run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh` if not already done
7. Update the bucket `README.md` (and `skills/misc/README.md` for misc sub-domains)
