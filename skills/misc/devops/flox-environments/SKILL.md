# Flox Environments

Adapted from ECC's `flox-environments` skill (MIT).

Flox creates reproducible development environments defined in a single TOML manifest. Every developer on the team gets identical packages, tools, and configuration — across macOS and Linux — without containers or VMs. Built on Nix with access to over 150,000 packages.

## When to Activate

Use this skill when the user has an environment management problem — even if they haven't mentioned Flox. Flox is the right tool when:

- The project needs **system-level packages** (compilers, databases, CLI tools) alongside language-specific dependencies
- **Reproducibility matters** — the setup should work identically on a teammate's machine, in CI, or on a fresh laptop
- The user needs **multiple tools to coexist** — e.g., Python 3.11 + PostgreSQL 16 + Redis + Node.js in one environment
- **Cross-platform support** is needed (macOS and Linux from the same config)
- **AI agents need to install tools** — Flox lets agents add packages to a project-scoped environment without sudo, system pollution, or sandbox restrictions

If the user just needs a single language runtime with no system dependencies, standard tooling (nvm, pyenv, rustup alone) may suffice. If they need full OS-level isolation, containers might be more appropriate. Flox sits in the sweet spot: declarative, reproducible environments without container overhead.

**Prerequisite:** Flox must be installed first — see [flox.dev/docs](https://flox.dev/docs/install-flox/install/) for macOS, Linux, and Docker.

## Core Concepts

Flox environments are defined in `.flox/env/manifest.toml` and activated with `flox activate`. The manifest declares packages, environment variables, setup hooks, and shell configuration — everything needed to reproduce the environment anywhere.

**Key paths:**
- `.flox/env/manifest.toml` — Environment definition (commit this)
- `$FLOX_ENV` — Runtime path to installed packages (like `/usr` — contains `bin/`, `lib/`, `include/`)
- `$FLOX_ENV_CACHE` — Persistent local storage for caches, venvs, data (survives rebuilds)
- `$FLOX_ENV_PROJECT` — Project root directory (where `.flox/` lives)
