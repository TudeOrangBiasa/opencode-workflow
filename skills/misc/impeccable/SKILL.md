name: impeccable
description: "Use when the user wants to design, redesign, shape, critique, audit, polish, clarify, distill, harden, optimize, adapt, animate, colorize, extract, or otherwise improve a frontend interface. Covers websites, landing pages, dashboards, product UI, app shells, components, forms, settings, onboarding, and empty states. Handles UX review, visual hierarchy, information architecture, cognitive load, accessibility, performance, responsive behavior, theming, anti-patterns, typography, fonts, spacing, layout, alignment, color, motion, micro-interactions, UX copy, error states, edge cases, i18n, and reusable design systems or tokens. Also use for bland designs that need to become bolder or more delightful, loud designs that should become quieter, live browser iteration on UI elements, or ambitious visual effects that should feel technically extraordinary. Not for backend-only or non-UI tasks."

## ROUTING TABLE — when this skill loads, drill into the right sub-command

This skill is a router. When `impeccable` loads, identify the user's intent and load the matching `reference/<sub>.md` file. **Do not proceed with generic design advice — load the sub-command file first.**

| User intent | Load | Sub-command |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| New project context, scaffold DESIGN.md | [reference/document.md](reference/document.md) | `impeccable document` |
| Run the full 5-dimension quality audit (a11y, performance, design, content, IA) | [reference/audit.md](reference/audit.md) | `impeccable audit` |
| Judgment-call design critique (aesthetics, taste) | [reference/critique.md](reference/critique.md) | `impeccable critique` |
| Polish pass before sign-off (last-mile quality) | [reference/polish.md](reference/polish.md) | `impeccable polish` |
| Build a new interface from scratch | [reference/craft.md](reference/craft.md) | `impeccable craft` |
| Adapt existing UI to a new context/screen | [reference/adapt.md](reference/adapt.md) | `impeccable adapt` |
| Live browser iteration / HMR | [reference/live.md](reference/live.md) | `impeccable live` |
| Add motion / animation | [reference/animate.md](reference/animate.md) | `impeccable animate` |
| Color treatment | [reference/colorize.md](reference/colorize.md) | `impeccable colorize` |
| Make bolder | [reference/bolder.md](reference/bolder.md) | `impeccable bolder` |
| Make quieter | [reference/quieter.md](reference/quieter.md) | `impeccable quieter` |
| Distill / simplify | [reference/distill.md](reference/distill.md) | `impeccable distill` |
| Clarify confusing UI | [reference/clarify.md](reference/clarify.md) | `impeccable clarify` |
| Robustness / edge cases | [reference/harden.md](reference/harden.md) | `impeccable harden` |
| Performance optimization | [reference/optimize.md](reference/optimize.md) | `impeccable optimize` |
| Typography | [reference/typeset.md](reference/typeset.md) | `impeccable typeset` |
| Add delight / micro-interactions | [reference/delight.md](reference/delight.md) | `impeccable delight` |
| Shape the work before implementing | [reference/shape.md](reference/shape.md) | `impeccable shape` |
| Extract reusable patterns | [reference/extract.md](reference/extract.md) | `impeccable extract` |
| Onboarding flows | [reference/onboard.md](reference/onboard.md) | `impeccable onboard` |
| Maximum ambition | [reference/overdrive.md](reference/overdrive.md) | `impeccable overdrive` |
| Brand/landing pages (marketing) | [reference/brand.md](reference/brand.md) | register: brand |
| Product UI (app, dashboard, tool) | [reference/product.md](reference/product.md) | register: product |

**If user's intent is unclear**, ask one question, then route. Do not guess.

Designs and iterates production-grade frontend interfaces. Real working code, committed design choices, exceptional craft.

## Setup

1. Load context (PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md): `node {{scripts_path}}/load-context.mjs`
2. Identify register: **brand** (marketing) or **product** (app UI)
3. If user invoked sub-command (craft, shape, audit), load its reference file too

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed setup, context gathering, and register identification.

## Shared design laws

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for detailed laws.

**Color:** OKLCH, never #000/#fff. Strategy: Restrained/Committed/Full/Drenched.
**Theme:** Scene sentence before dark/light choice.
**Typography:** 65-75ch line length. 1.25× scale ratio.
**Layout:** Vary spacing. Cards are lazy. Don't wrap everything.
**Motion:** Don't animate layout. Exponential ease-out.
**Bans:** No side-stripe borders, gradient text, glassmorphism, hero-metric, identical card grids, modal-first.
**Copy:** Every word earns its place. No em dashes.
**AI slop test:** Category-reflex check at two altitudes.

## Commands

See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for full commands table, routing rules, and pin/unpin details.
